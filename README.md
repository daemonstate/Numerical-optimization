# Numerical-optimization
Numerical optimizaition methods are powerful methods for optimization of objective function considering computing resource constraint and other constraints. 

A deep explanation of implementation is given in this repository. 4 methods implemented are bisection, secant, regular falsi and newton method of finding optimal solution in some bounds.

Grid search and random jump methods are also implemented at a different jupyter notebook.
